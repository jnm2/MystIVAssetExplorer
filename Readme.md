# Myst IV Asset Explorer

Browse and extract Myst IV game assets, and play audio assets in-app with gapless looping in a high-performance app built with [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/).

## How to use

Make sure Myst IV is installed somewhere under your `Program Files (x86)` directory (or on a 32-bit operating system, `Program Files`). Myst IV Asset Explorer will autodetect the path to the `data\*.m4b` files.

Download and run the .exe file from the latest release of Myst IV Asset Explorer from <https://github.com/jnm2/MystIVAssetExplorer/releases> and run it. If .NET 8 or newer is not installed, the app will take you to the download page for .NET 8.

## Audio

To explore the audio for the game, expand the `sound.m4b/data` folder and click on various `.sb0` files which define the audio streams for the game. For language-specific audio files, expand the top-level language folder and its contained `sound.m4b/data`.

Myst IV stores audio in three audio formats: uncompressed PCM, a proprietary Ubisoft format based on IMA ADPCM, and Ogg Vorbis. All three can be played back and exported. The ADPCM format is converted to uncompressed PCM (*.wav) before exporting.

The game's music is contained in `mu_music.sb0`, `music_personality_test.sb0`, and the `sequence_*.sp0` files. See [Music not included in the soundtrack](#music-not-included-in-the-soundtrack) and [Soundtrack music and variants](#soundtrack-music-and-variants) for overviews of the music in the game.
